# StarGazer

## Second project for our coding class

Stargazer application where users can search, find, and even create constellations from stars pulled from an API of stars and associated information.

API - NASA Database reference library
Search/display information on stars/systems by various criteria - size, whether it has a system of planets, what consellation it's in if any - or find a random star
CRUD options to create users/Stargazers
Second Database
"What if you could make your own constellation"
Since you can't create a star well you can but there are a lot of stars
3rd Party libraries: ?
Users > Create Constellations > Save constellations by user?
JOIN DATABASES
